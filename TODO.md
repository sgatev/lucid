## Dataflow

### Reuse the state a vertex already has

`RunDataflow` asks `Transfer` for a whole new state on every visit, compares it against
the one the vertex holds, and move-assigns over it, which frees the tables the old one
had sized. An `Update(State&, ...) -> bool` in place of `Transfer` would let an analysis
grow into that capacity instead of allocating its own, but deciding whether anything
changed needs the old value, so the change detection has to be rethought along with it.
A state that held a hash table would also want a `Clear` on it, which there is none of.

## Tests and benchmarks

### Benchmark a function that branches

The snippets `ChainedValues` and `LiveValues` in [`reg_bench`](lucid/am/reg_bench.cc) are
straight-line, so the graph they build has almost no branching and the join path of
`RunDataflow` barely runs. Avoiding the copies in the analyses moved these benchmarks 3-6%
while moving a chain of diamonds 3.3-6.3x, which is to say the benchmarks do not yet
measure the part of the work that changed.
